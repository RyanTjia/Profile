This is a practice to improve my current understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Exercise 1
Create an HTML/Javascript page that will create the following game:
First, a button will appear that when clicked a 5X5 board will appear and the game will start
Once the game starts
	a) A number from 3 to 9 will appear above the table
	b) The table cells will be filled with a random number from 1 to 100
	c) A timer will appear which starts from 30 seconds
The goal is to find multiples of the number above the table from the numbers in the table. Choosing the correct number will turn the cell color to green, otherwise red.
Once the 30 seconds is up, the user's score will be displayed

Exercise 2
Create a page in which there will be an input form to insert publication data.
1) The page should initially have a textarea for the title of the publication, a textbox for the authors, a textbox (read only) for thematic sections and an "Add thematic section" button for adding thematic sections. When the user clicks on "Add thematic section" then a div will appear that will have a dropdownlist with
	a) Topics
	b) An "add" button
	c) A "close" button
When the user clicks "add" then the thematic section will be added to the textbox of the thematic sections, while when the user clicks close the div will disappear.
2) When the user clicks the "Submit" button, then the publication details will be displayed consisting of the authors' names and the publication title and thematic sections.

Exercise 3
Create an HTML/Javascript page that will create the following game:
The page will initially display a "Start" button and an empty 4X4 panel.
When the user presses the "Start" button the following will happen:
	a) The Start button will be disabled.
	b) Table cells will be filled with random numbers 0-9
	c) Below the panel a timer will start a counting down of 10 seconds.
	d) When the user clicks on a cell, if the cell's number is greater than 5 then the cell will turn green otherwise it will turn red.
Once the 10 second time ends, the following will happen:
The "Start" button will be enabled.
The timer under the board will stop.
A message appears showing how many turned green and how many turned red

Exercise 4
Create a page in which there will be a table with 4 cells (table 1) in each of which there is a photo, and a table (table 2) with one row (no cells).
When the user clicks on one of the photos then it will disappear from table 1 and a new cell will be created in table 2 and inside it the selected photo.
The page should be enriched with another "return pics" button which, when pressed by the user, will transfer the photos from table 2 to table 1 one by one every three seconds.
